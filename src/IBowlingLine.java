  C Sc 335 
  Interface for the Bowling line project

  Iteration 1: The model

This interface abstractly describes one design for maintaining
bowling line scores.  Since we will run tests on your code,
use this design. We need method signatures to match.  This
will be the last time we run tests on your code. It will be
up to you to write your own tests in the future.
